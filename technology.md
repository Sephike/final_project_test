# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Python scripts and multiple libraries will be used in Jupyter Notebook to clean and analyze the dataset.  Specifially the Pandas library will be used to clean the dataset.  Numpy may be used for some light statistical analysis.

## Database Storage
The starting data set will be imported into Postgres using SQL.  The appropriate password and config files will be added to access the Postgres database.  

## Machine Learning
A basic linear regression or logistic model will be the initial machine learning model.  Visual Studio Code maybe used to clean or compare python scripts or to update the markdown.

## Dashboard
The final outputs will have an interactive display on Tableau Pupblic and communicated through Google Slides.
